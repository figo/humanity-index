### What is humanity index

Every person on the planet is invaluable, but we don't know how much positive impact each person brings in everyday, how each person suffers everyday. If we can measure those, and be aware of those on a daily basis, empathy and motivation will arise, our world will be a better place when we all take actions to improve the humanity index.


Here are some examples of better informed decisions, waste less, eat healthier, smile more, or even volunteer yourself in the community.
